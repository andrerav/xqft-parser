\chapter*{Abstract}

XQuery is a flexible language for querying XML data across a variety of storage
methods. This Master's thesis is a part of iAD, an ongoing research effort in next generation information access
solutions. iAD is hosted by Fast Search \& Transfer, a company at the time developing their next search engine
platform MARS.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate the possibilities for utilising
XQuery as a query interface to MARS. And specififcally to find a way to translate XQuery to the MARS relational algebra language MQL.

The project resulted in the develpment of a novel translation method, dubbed ``Tainting Dependencies''.
Based on this method, a proof of concept has been implemented for generation of algebra.

This method of translation which produces algebra significantly less complex than that produced by an existing
method dubbed ``Loop Lifting''. These methods are then compared and evaluated through discussion.
