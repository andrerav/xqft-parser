\chapter*{Abstract}

XQuery is a flexible language for querying XML data across a variety of storage
methods. This Master's thesis is a part of iAD, an ongoing research effort in next generation information access
solutions. iAD is hosted by Fast Search \& Transfer, a company at the time developing their next search engine
platform MARS. \ldots XQuery as a query interface to MARS.

The result of this project is a novel method of translating XQuery to MARS relational algebra dubbed ``Tainting
Dependencies''. This method seeks to avoid unecessary denormalisation --> sjekk discussion

This method of translation which produces algebra significantly less complex than that produced by an existing
method dubbed ``Loop Lifting''. These methods are then compared and evaluated through discussion.
