\chapter*{Abstract}
XQuery is a flexible language for querying XML data across a variety of storage
methods. For efficient execution of queries on seminally large and indexed data
sets, it is of particular interest to translate XQuery queries to relational
algebra.

As a continuation of the development of the XQuery Full-Text Parser (XQFT
Parser)\cite{ourselves}, a novel translation method has been developed, dubbed
``Tainting Dependencies''. Additionally, a proof of concept has been
implemented for generation of algebra for the MARS execution engine developed
by FAST.

The result is a method of translation which produces algebra significantly less
complex than that produced by an existing method dubbed ``loop lifting''. These
methods are then compared and evaluated through discussion.
