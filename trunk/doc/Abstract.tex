\chapter*{Abstract}
Limitations in the present commodity search technology has spurred
an interest in employing more powerful query languages capable of both
structural and full-text queries, and joining results from several different data
sources. One such language is XQuery. However, few existing implementations of
XQuery are licensed liberally, suitable for interfacing with new execution
backends, and platform-independent. 

An XQuery parser front-end with full-text extensions meeting the requirements
mentioned above has been developed. With Java as a development platform, the
ANTLR parser generator was used to generate a parser from an adapted and
modified grammar based on the W3C XQuery recommendation. 

The result is a fairly complete and flexible parser front-end which passes
99.3\% of the test cases in a modified XQuery compliance test, and is capable of
producing abstract syntax trees suitable for data flow analysis and further 
transformation.
