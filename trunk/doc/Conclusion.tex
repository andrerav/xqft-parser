\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}

In the course of this project we have investigated the current state of XQuery implementations (with and without full-text extensions) as well as XQuery as a language. In addition we have examinated and evaluated multiple parser generators suitable for a project based on our requirements, and finally chose ANTLR. Features of interest as well as limitations of this parser generator were also documented.
The reason for choosing ANTLR was firstly because it utilizes a grammar specification syntactically close to the EBNF W3C makes use of. In addition, the parser generator supports various types of predicates and automatic abstract syntax tree generation -- features really convenient when creating more than a non-trivial recognizer. These as well as other features of interest and limitations in ANTLR were documented in this report.

Rewriting the XQuery full-text specification to conform to ANTLR grammar syntax and semantics proved to be a non-trivial task. This is because the specification contains ambiguous terminals. An LL lexer capable of handling these must be aware of the context the incomming characters. We evaluated a number of different approaches to this. 

After implementing a prototype state driven lexer for a subset of XQuery, we discovered that only a few states would be needed to solve the non-determinism. Additionally we found that by making the parser communicate the state to the lexer the implementation would be much less complex. To make this work we had to implement functionality in the lexer to generate tokens one by one, overriding the default ANTLR generated lexer manner of operation. A great deal of the terminal ambiuities were solved by this parser controlled state driven strategy. The reminder were solved by converting some non-terminals to enclosed composite terminals.

Because of the chosen lexer strategy, a goal was to reduce required parser lookahead. This combined with

In this project we have developed a front-end parser for XQuery with support for full-text extensions. The parser produces a usable AST that can be easily modified, and is suitable for further usage.




\begin{itemize}
  \item A fairly complete XQuery full-text parser front end capable of
  generating abstract syntax trees and with a test coverage of
  99.3\%\footnote{As noted and emphasized in section
  \ref{sect:discussion:coverageResults},
  these results are not immediately comparable with officially published results
  from the W3C}


  \item A suitable XQuery full-text grammar specification for ANTLR based on the
  W3C recommendation
  \item Investigation and documentation as well as resolve for several unexpected
  problems and ambiguities in the grammar
  punktene over?
  \item Grammar rewrite rules and operators to generate abstract
  syntax trees for XQuery full-text queries, as well as evaluation of their
  usefulness
  \item A prototype for scoping, symbol tables, and lookups in an XQuery
  full-text parser
  \item Improved default ANTLR error handling by giving the responsibility
  of error handling to the calling program
  \item A test harness for executing detailed coverage tests based on the
  official XQuery test suite
\end{itemize}


\underline{\textbf{\LARGE //TODO:}}
s\aa~konklusjon


hva ble gjort for \aa ~f\aa~ opp dekningskrav hovedgrunner, litt fremtid, litt
av alt egentlig? 

Vi maa si noe om hva vi synes selv ogsaa, om vi er fornoyde osv. Vi maa ha en
definitiv konklusjon, f.eks ``Vi har utviklet en parser av grei kvalitet som vi
er fornoyd med''
