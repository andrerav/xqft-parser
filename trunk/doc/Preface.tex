\chapter*{Preface}

This report is the result of the the course "TDT4510, Data- og informasjonsforvaltning, fordypningsprosjekt" at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, during the autumn of 2007. It is a response to the following task:

\begin{quote}
``The assignment is to make an experimental parser for XQuery. XQuery is a query language for structured and semi-structured data and is specified as an XML standard by W3C. The parser should generate an intermediate representation that later can be used to generate relational algebra for evaluation of queries. It must support the free-text search extensions and written in Java. Any components used by the parser should not have license terms that limit its use. The project is part of the iAD project at NTNU."
\end{quote}

We would like to thank our supervisors, Svein-Olaf Hvasshovd at NTNU and \O ystein Torbj\o rnsen at Fast, for good feedback and guidance during the course of this project.
