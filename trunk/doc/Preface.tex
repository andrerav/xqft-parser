\chapter*{Preface}

This report is the result of the the course "TDT4510, Data- og
informasjonsforvaltning, fordypningsprosjekt" at the Norwegian University of
Science and Technology, during the autumn of 2007. It is a response to the
following task:

\begin{quote}
``Make an experimental parser for XQuery. XQuery is a
query language for structured and semi-structured data and is specified as an
XML standard by W3C. The parser should preferably generate an intermediate
representation that later can be used to generate relational algebra for
evaluation of queries. It should if possible support the full-text search
extensions and must be written in Java. Any components used by the parser should
not have license terms that limits its use. The project is part of the iAD
project at NTNU."
\end{quote}

We would like to thank our supervisors, Svein-Olaf Hvasshovd at NTNU and \O
ystein Torbj\o rnsen at Fast, for feedback and guidance during the course
of this project.
