\underline{\textbf{\LARGE //TODO: Andreas}} Saksa det her fra future work... kan det bli mer diskusjon i stedet? Evt ogs\aa~dele det opp i to sections...

\subsection{Type Checking}
Currently the parser will not perform type checking on the parsed queries. This
is an essential feature and will be necessary to implement for the parser to be
applicable in any realistic setting. A type checking system with proper type
inference and synthesis could be a complex feature to implement in a language
such as XQuery, and might require considerable effort, especially in quality
assurance. 

However, the resulting AST output from the parser (presented in section
\ref{sect:results:parser_output_ast}) should be a solid base to improve upon by
adding proper type inference and type checking. This would require a framework
for dataflow analysis. This is a substantial amount of work, but it would
benefit the project in several ways, for example the possibility of adding
optimizations.

\subsection{Scoping and Symbol Tables on AST}
Currently the scoping and symbol tables are being used directly in the grammar -
that is, during parse time. It would be benefitial to move this into being
performed in run time, and combine with type checking functionality.
