The W3C claims their XQuery specification is expressed as a LL(1)-grammar\cite{createTokenizer}, as in the simplest cases can be seen with bare eyes, and also noted by \cite{kang_xquery_diglib}, this is not true. Because we chose the parser controlled strategy, our system's correctness depends on that the parser is a LL(k) parser with a small k.

Additionally, the grammar was, despite stated as such
by the W3C, not a LL(1) grammar but rather LL(k), for some undetermined \verb!k!
(also noted by \cite{kang_xquery_diglib}).
