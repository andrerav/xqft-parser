During the course of this project some misconceptions of the ANTLR grammar specification semantics and the W3C XQuery specification semantics have lead to erroneous implementation of various aspects of the parser. As the lessons were learned, these errors have later been corrected and will be accounted for in the following sections.

\subsection{Seperation of terminals from non-terminals }

In the grammar specified by W3C the productions, both terminal and non-terminal, all start with uppercase letters. Initially this caused some confusion because this grammar generated a very big lexer and a very small and non-functional parser.
