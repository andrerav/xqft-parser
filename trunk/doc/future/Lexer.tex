\subsection{Lexer Error Handling}
\label{sect:future_work:lexer_error_handling}
As noted in sections \ref{sect:error_handling:syntax_errors} and
\ref{sec:impl:errorhandling}, the \verb!nextToken()! method in the lexer base class
would ``hijack'' lexical exceptions and handle them by printing an error message
to stderr and then attempting to recover from the error by simply consuming the
offending character and ignoring it in the following construction of tokens. It is 
not immediately appareant, but the \verb!nextToken()! method can not be overridden and
forced to throw the exception onwards, due to the method signature itself which
does not allow exceptions to be thrown. 

However, one possible solution to this problem could be to override the \verb!nextToken()! method and employ the observer design pattern to allow a simple and decoupled way of flagging an exception to the parser.
