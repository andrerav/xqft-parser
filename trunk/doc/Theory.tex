% Innledning
XML is designed for encapsulation of structured and semistructured data,
relational data, and object repositories. The XQuery query language is designed
to perform flexible queries in such documents. A translation of such a
language to relational algebra requires detailed knowledge about XQuery for a
proper translation to be made. In this chapter, section
\ref{sect:theory:xquery} describes important details about the XQuery
language that are essential to this task. Further, existing implementations of
such translators are documented and compared.

Additionally, the concept of classic relational algebra itself is outlined in
section \ref{sect:theory:relAlg}, as the target algebra will be based on much
of its semantics.

Then in section \ref{sect:parser_and_syntaxtrees}, some common strategies for
parsing and construction of parser are outlined, as well as techniques for
parsing syntax trees.

Finally, a thoroughly researched method for translating XQuery to relational
algebra dubbed ``loop lifting'' is described in section
\ref{sect:theory:loop_lifting}.
