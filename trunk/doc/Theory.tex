\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we have presented the basic facets of XQuery and XPath,
especially language features such as FLWOR constructs, path expressions, 
full-text extensions, and precedence. This creates a context for the subsequent
chapters where we will set out to create an XQuery parser with full-text
extensions. 

Further we have investigated existing implementations, both with and without
full-text extensions. These implementations will provide valuable points of
reference for our implementation in the following chapters.

In the next chapter, we will outline the architectural decisions made in this
project.
