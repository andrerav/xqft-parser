\begin{myDefinition}
\label{definition:normalisation}
The process of \textbf{normalisation} is defined as the process of translating the
whole or parts of an XQuery abstract syntax tree into an XQuery Core abstract
syntax tree, as described in section \ref{sect:theory:xquery:XQcore}.
\end{myDefinition}

\begin{myDefinition}
\label{definition:denormalised}
An abstract syntax tree is said to be \textbf{denormalised} if it has not yet
been normalised through a process of normalisation.
\end{myDefinition}

The basic abstract syntax tree produced by the XQFT Parser (see section
\ref{sect:theory:xqftparser}) is in a denormalised form. As explained in
section \ref{sect:theory:xquery:XQcore} on page
\pageref{sect:theory:xquery:XQcore}, normalisation has the benefit of
simplification without loss of expressiveness or semantics, and thus
simplifying the task of translating the syntax tree.

Based on findings in section \ref{sect:theory:xquery:Flwor} regarding the
structure of FLWOR expressions, it was briefly mentioned that complex FLWOR
expressions could be transformed into semantically equivalent and simpler
representations. A question was also posed --\emph{ could it be
benefitial to rewrite complex FLWOR expressions into a simpler form}? \textbf{\LARGE TODO:} er det?

\subsection{Normalising FLWOR expressions}
A denormalised XQuery syntax tree may contain nodes such \texttt{for}-clause expressions with several variable
declarations and assignments as can be seen in figure \ref{tree:ast:flwor_rewrite1}. Such an expression should be
normalised to several nested FLWOR expressions, as shown in figure \ref{tree:ast:flwor_rewrite2}, as defined by
the mapping rules in figures \ref{figure:xquery:flwor_mapping_rule},
\ref{figure:xquery:where_mapping_rule},
\ref{figure:xquery:orderby_mapping_rule}, and
\ref{figure:xquery:return_mapping_rule}.

Here, the method in section \ref{sect:theory:xquery:core:rewriting_flwor} has
been applied to the example tree in figure \ref{figure:ast_rewrite:flwor1},
and the result can be seen in figure \ref{figure:ast_rewrite:flwor3}. The
corresponding hypothetical source code for the denormalised and normalised trees
can be seen in figure \ref{figure:ast_rewrite:flwor_src}.

Based on these findings, it is natural to conclude that normalisation of FLWOR
expressions is benefitial for the sake of simplicity. Normalisation may be
attained by executing a specialised \textit{rewrite visitor} on the syntax
tree, which will be described in chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}.
