\section{Licensing}
\label{sect:method:licensing}
One requirement for the parser is a liberal open source software license.
Several such liberal licenses exist, however here we shall concentrate on a
short selection of popular and widely adopted licenses. These have been gathered
from the Open Source Initiative (OSI) website\cite{osi_website}, from the
category
``\emph{Licenses that are popular and widely used or with strong communities}''.
