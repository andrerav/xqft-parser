\chapter{Future Work}
\label{chapter:future}
The outcome of this project is a fairly well-defined method of translation,
there is still headroom for improvement and continued research. In particular,
this relates to performance benchmarking, simplifications and optimisations,
and improvement of XQuery feature support.

We propose the following research related to performance benchmarking:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Given that FAST develops a working implementation of an MQL processor
  some time in the future, it could be interesting to extend or rewrite the
  prototype developed here, and execute the XMark benchmark suite and compare
  to other existing implementations
  \item If a working MQL processor can not or will not be developed in the
  foreseeable future, then the prototype and the rules of TD may be modified
  and interfaced with MonetDB
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}	
  \item Sammenligne ytelse med Pathfinder n\aa r Fast har f\aa tt p\aa~plass en impl.
  \item Sammenligne ytelse med Pathfinder paa MonetDB (det kunne funket) 
  \item Finne et typesystem (hvis ikke dette er gjort i l\o pet av Discussion)
  \item Finne mer simplifications og optimisations
\end{itemize}
