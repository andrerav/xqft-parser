\section{Context-sensitive Visitor}
\label{sect:impl:context_sens_visitor}
In Section \ref{sect:theory:parser:tree_parsing} a number of techniques for
tree parsing were presented. In Section \ref{sect:method:tree_parsing} the
\textit{context-sensitive visitor pattern} was chosen as the technique for this
implementation. 

The context-sensitive pattern is designed to be flexible and to generate code
with a higher level of maintainability, for which the rationale was presented
in Section \ref{sect:theory:contextVisitorPattern}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The class diagram for the actual implementation of the context-sensitive
visitor pattern can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:impl:context_sens_visitor_impl}.
Compare this to the generalised class diagram in figure
\ref{figure:parser:context_visitor_pattern} on page
\pageref{figure:parser:context_visitor_pattern}.

Note that the use of \texttt{XQFTTree} as the element class implies that the
\texttt{XQFTTree} be supplemented with an \texttt{accept()} method to
accommodate this pattern. This method is essentially a static dispatcher which
will call the appropriate method on the visitor based on the token type of the
node currently being visited. Figure \ref{fig:impl:accept} shows an excerpt of this method and
how it acts on the visitor class.

The prototype utilises two different visitors, namely the \textit{Rewrite visitor} and the \textit{XQuery2MQL
visitor}. The \textit{Rewrite visitor} is used to perform rewrite operations on the
abstract syntax tree before performing the actual translation. In particular,
these rewrite operations consists of normalising the required subtrees of the
syntax tree to a subset of XQuery Core (as described in sections
\ref{sect:theory:xquery:XQcore} and \ref{sect:method:ast_rewrite}).

The \textit{XQuery2MQL visitor} performs the bulk of the work related to
performing the translation of XQuery to MQL. This visitor is capable of
re-instantiating itself (or other visitors) when entering new contexts, such as
path predicates.
