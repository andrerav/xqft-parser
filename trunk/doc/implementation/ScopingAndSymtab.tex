\section{Scoping and symbol tables}
Crucial to the implementation of the \textit{tainting dependencies} methodology
described in section \ref{sect:trans:taintingDependencies} is the ability to
maintain a contextual environment with scoping and symbol tables. This section
details the implementation of this, and how it is used to achieve the
requirements of \textit{tainting dependencies}.

\subsection{Concepts}
The scoping system in the implementation is based on building a scope tree. The
previous scope, if any, is set as parent of the new scope, and the previous
scope maintains a list of child scopes. A reference to the root scope node is
maintained. Considering the example XQuery query in figure
\ref{fig:impl:scope_tree_ex_code}, the scope tree in figure
\ref{fig:impl:scope_tree_ex} is generated.

\end{figure}

Entries in the symbol table are represented through an instance of the
\texttt{SymTabEntry} class which maintains metadata about symbols (such as
symbol name, a flag indicating whether it's an iterator variable, and an
evaluated expression). The symbol table is realized as a subclass of the
\texttt{HashMap} class in the \texttt{java.util} package, and is constrained to
storing instances of \texttt{SymTabEntry}, with the symbol name as key.

\subsection{Semantics}
The scoping semantics is encapsulated in a singleton manner in the class
\texttt{Scope}, with static methods available for pushing and popping scopes,
and storing and retrieving symbols. The external (static) API as available to a
user of the scope system is shown in figure \ref{fig:impl:scope_uml}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

A new scope is \textit{pushed} whenever a for-clause is encountered while
parsing the abstract syntax tree, and the current scope is \textit{popped} while
evaluating a return clause -- both of which occur within a FLWOR expression.

The scoping system also tracks iteration variables. That is, for any scope,
there is \textit{one and only one} iteration variable, except in the top scope
where there is no iteration variable. The concept of an iteration variable is
explain in definition \ref{} TODO: definisjon av iteratorvars. Tracking these
variables are necessary to implement the \textit{tainting dependencies} methodology (explained
later in section \ref{sect:impl:tainting_deps} on page
\pageref{sect:impl:tainting_deps}).
