\section{Constructing the MQL algebra tree}
The MQL queries are constructed as a tree of operators bottom-up while parsing
the abstract syntax tree (for the corresponding XQuery query). 

\subsection{Operators and parameters}

\end{center}
\end{figure}
The operators modeled in the implementation correspond to the operators
described in section \ref{sect:method:marsOperators}. A simplified class
diagram is shown in figure \ref{fig:impl:mql_op_uml}. Note that the
responsibility with regards to converting an operator to a string
representation is largely left to the various subclasses. However, the default
fallback for the \texttt{Operator} class is to return a string of the form
\begin{Verbatim}
operator_name(param1, param2, ..., paramN; 
              operator1, operator2, ..., operatorM)
\end{Verbatim}
This is sufficient in some cases, such as for the model of the \texttt{cross()}
operator.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

MQL arameters (as described in \ref{sect:method:mql:concepts}) are modelled as
seen in figure \ref{fig:impl:mql_param_uml}. Parameters require no complex
structure, and are only created and added to operators as needed.

\subsection{Concepts}
As mentioned, MQL queries are represented as trees, where each node represents
an operator. Each node is an instance of an operator class (as described
above), and contains a list of child operators and a list of parameters. To
convert the operator tree to a MQL query string, simply call the method
\texttt{toPrettyString(0)} on the root node of the operator tree.

\subsection{Usage}
The operator classes are designed to be intuitive and simple to use. Figure
\ref{fig:impl:mql_op_ex1_java} shows one example where a simple operator tree
is built and converted to an MQL query string (the result of which can be seen
in figure \ref{fig:impl:mql_op_ex1_mql}).
