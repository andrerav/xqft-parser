\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}
In this chapter, some important aspects of this project will be discussed. Some
of them are concrete problems or challenges, others are of a more predictive
nature and may serve as a basis for further research. Also, possible
solutions or ideas are proposed where applicable. 

Most importantly, XQuery features not
currently supported by ``Tainting Dependencies'' are discussed, as well as
possible optimisations. The proof of concept whose implementation was
described in chapter \ref{chapter:implementation} is discussed, and in
particular implementation-specific details. Further, the results presented in
the previous chapter are discussed, and insecurities and sources of errors are
accounted for. This chapter is finalised by discussion of syntax tree rewriting
and normalisation, a discussion of problems related to sequences, and a
discussion of the XQuery type system and related problems.

, we have a few assumptions. A scope defined as a parameter to
the \textsf{scope}-operator starting with a slash (\textsf{/}) is an absolute scope. That means if the parameter
is e.g. \textsf{/a/b}, the operator will remove any tuples in the input relation where the $scope$ attribute does
not define the tuple to stem from a \texttt{b} scope within the root-scope \texttt{a}. Without a slash first in
the parameter, the scope is relative. E.g. \texttt{a/b} as a parameter will lead to removal of all tuples where
the $scope$ attribute does not define the tuple to stem from a \texttt{b} scope within an \texttt{a} scope.
