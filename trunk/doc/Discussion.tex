\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}
In this chapter, some important aspects of this project will be discussed. Some
of them are concrete problems or challenges, others are of a more predictive
nature and may serve as a basis for further research. Also, possible
solutions or ideas are proposed. 

Most importantly, XQuery features not
currently supported by ``Tainting Dependencies'' are discussed, as well as
possible optimisations. The proof of concept whose implementation was
described in chapter \ref{chapter:implementation} is discussed, and in
particular implementation-specific details. Further, the results presented in
the previous chapter is discussed, and insecurities and sources of errors are
accounted for. This chapter is finalized by discussion of syntax tree rewriting
and normalisation, a discussion of problems related to sequences, and a
discussion of the XQuery type system and related problems.
