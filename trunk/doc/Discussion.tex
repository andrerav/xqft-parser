\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}
In this chapter, some central aspects of this project will be discussed. Some
of them are concrete problems or challenges, others are of a more predictive
nature and may serve as a basis for further research. Also, possible
solutions or ideas are proposed where applicable. 

Most importantly, XQuery features not currently supported by Tainting
Dependencies (TD) are discussed. Challenges related to XQuery sequences are
presented, and some possible solutions are proposed. The external environment
and communication with it poses some problems which are reviewed, and the
lack of support for a type system in TD is elaborated upon as well.
Furthermore, we discuss some optimisations and how they may be implemented.
The prototype implementation and the usage of syntax tree normalisation is
discussed. Finally, we briefly analyse the results presented in the previous
chapter, and insecurities as well as possible sources of errors are accounted
for.
