\section{XQuery}
\label{sect:theory:xquery}

XQuery is a query language developed by the XML Query working group of W3C.
Version 1.0\cite{w3c00} became a W3C Recommendation January 2007. It was
designed as a response to an emerging task: to intelligently express queries in
the increasing amounts of information stored, exchanged and presented using
XML. The language is derived from Quilt\cite{quilt_queryLanguage}. Development
of XQuery 1.0 was coordinated with the development of XSLT 2.0, and the two
teams cooperated on development of XPath 2.0.

XQuery can be used to query any kind of data structure that can be represented
as an XML document. This includes text documents, relational databases and XML-compliant HTML markup.

\subsection{Basic language features}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:basics}
XQuery is a functional language with a comparatively small syntax. It lacks
some features known from many functional languages, such as support for higher
order function declarations.\marginpar{vet ikke hva higher order function declarations er jeg, hva skjer med
external?} However, it has some of the most important benefits, such as a lack of side-effects. XQuery is a
\textit{declarative} language (as opposed to \textit{imperative} languages), and
is strongly typed. Static typing is optional, and may vary between various
implementations.


XQuery is an orthogonal language, meaning that most expressions can be
arbitrarily nested. For example, a path expression predicate can be another
path expression:
\begin{center}
\texttt{/a/b[/c/d[e]]}
\end{center}
Or, the return-clause in a loop construct can be another loop
construct:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$i in (1,2,3) } \\ \quad 
\texttt{return for \$j in (4,5,6)} \\ \quad\quad 
\texttt{return \$i + \$j}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These features are important to consider for later translation, as truth values
in predicates and return values may need to be coerced and/or inferred into
their proper types and values.

The XQuery type system is rather complex, and we refer to some of the
introductory articles\cite{rys_xq_type_intro} by Michael Rys, as well as the
XQuery formal semantics specification\cite{xquery_semantics} for more
information about this. However, we will emphasize some important traits about
the type system:

\textbf{All sequences are one-dimensional}. Any given sequence that is not
one-dimensional, will be flattened. For example, the two-dimensional sequence
\verb!((1,2),3)! is to be flatted into \verb!(1,2,3)!.

Sequences can evaluate to an effective boolean value. Informally, this value is defined as follows:
\textbf{Anything that is not 0, empty, or \textit{false}, evaluates to \textit{true}}. In a boolean context (such
as an predicate or an \texttt{if..then..else}), this means that anything that is ``something'' will evaluate to
\textit{true}.


\subsection{Path Expressions}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:PathExpressions}
XPath (XML Path Language) is a small language for traversing and selecting
nodes (both element nodes and text nodes) from XML data. XPath is a subset of
XQuery, and is also available in XSLT, XML Schemas, XForms, and several other
technologies related to XML. 

In its abbreviated form, XPath bears a strong resemblance to file path syntax
known from many modern operating systems. This implies that the XPath syntax
may be familiar and intuitive for new users.

For example, consider the following XML source:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[h]{5.2cm}
\begin{verbatim}
<a>
  <b><c>Hello World</c></b>
</a>
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
If we execute the XPath expression \verb!/a/b/c!, we will receive the
\verb!c!-node which is a child of the \verb!b!-node which is a child of the
\verb!a!-node which is the document root node. Note that we will \textit{not}
receive the text \texttt{Hello World}, which is a \textbf{text node}, but rather its
parent node, which is the \verb!c!-node. To retrieve the text, we would rather
use the path expression \verb!/a/b/c/text()!. The  \verb!text()! expression is
known as a \textbf{kind test}. The following kind tests are available:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb!text()! - as described above, returns a text node
  \item \verb!comment()! - returns a comment node, for example \texttt{<!-- Hello
  world -->}
  \item \verb!processing-instruction()! - returns processing instructions, which
  means constructs such as \texttt{<?xml version="1.0"?>}
  \item \verb!node()! - returns any type of node 
\end{itemize} 

In its unabbreviated syntax (or, verbose syntax), the semantics of XPath
become more clear. For the XML source above, the full syntax for the path
expression to match the \verb!c!-node would be
\texttt{/child::a/child::b/child::c}. Here we see a new addition to our path
expression, the \verb!child::! axis specifier. An \textbf{axis specifier} helps
navigation within the XML document, by allowing the user to specify further
traits about the nodes to be matched. For example, attribute nodes can be
matched using \verb!attribute::! (or \verb!@!, with abbreviated syntax). For a
complete reference to axis specifiers, we refer to \cite{w3c01}.

\subsection{Predicates}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:Predicates}
Predicates are used in path expressions to filter nodes. Predicates are
appended to step expressions (and filter expressions, see \cite{w3c01}), and multiple predicates
are applied from left to right. Predicates never add to the node sets returned from the path expressions, they
only restrict by filtering. Predicate expressions are appended to step expressions within square brackets, like
this:
\begin{center}
\verb!/a/b[@id > 1]!
\end{center} 
This expression will return all \verb!b!-nodes within a \verb!a!-node and with an attribute \verb!id! whose value
is larger than one.

Consider the following XML source:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[h]{3.2cm}
\begin{verbatim}
<a>
  <b id="1">
    <c />
  </b>
  <b id="2">
    <c />
  </b>
</a>
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
If we apply the path expression mentioned above, we will thus receive the second
\verb!b!-node.

There are a few important things to note about predicates. Firstly, the
predicate expression can be any expression, and as such its return value is
coerced into a effective boolean value (either \textit{true} or \textit{false}), as
described previously in section \ref{sect:theory:xquery:basics}.

However, there is one important exception -- if the return value for the
predicate expression evaluates to a numerical value, then the predicate
becomes a \textbf{numeric predicate}, and its value is used to identify the
\textit{n}th node in the step expression. For example, the following path
expression returns the first \verb!b!-node: \verb!/a/b[1]!. As it is the first \verb!b!-node within the only
\verb!a!-node. \texttt{/a/b/c[1]} will select both \verb!c!-nodes of the document as they both are the first
\texttt{c}-node within their respected \texttt{b}-nodes.

\subsection{FLWOR}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:Flwor}

\begin{myDefinition}
\label{definition:iteration_expression}
An \textbf{iteration expression} or \textbf{iterator} is an XQuery expression consisting of an \textbf{iterator
variable} declaration and an \textbf{iterator body}. The \textbf{iterator body} is executed multiple times, and
for each time the \textbf{iterator variable} is bound to the next item in the \textbf{iterator sequence}.
\end{myDefinition}

XQuery is centered around a loop construct known as FLWOR, which is an acronym:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{F}or - iteration over tuples
  \item \textbf{L}et - assignment of tuples
  \item \textbf{W}here - conditional expression
  \item \textbf{O}rder by - sorting 
  \item \textbf{R}eturn - return expressions (similar to yielding in coroutines
  known from functional languages, not to be confused with a return statement
  in languages such as Java)
\end{itemize}
The FLWOR construct is thought to be roughly equivalent to a
\texttt{SELECT}-statement in SQL. For example, consider the following SQL
statement: 
\begin{center}
\verb!SELECT v.title FROM video v WHERE v.year = 1999!
\end{center}
And then compare it to the following XQuery counterpart:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$v in doc("videos.xml")//video} \\
\texttt{where \$v/year = 1999}\\
\texttt{return \$v/title}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Then construct a file \texttt{videos.xml} with the following contents:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[h]{9.5cm}
\begin{verbatim}
<videos>
  <video>
    <title>Plan 9 from outer space</title>
    <year>1959</year>
  </video>
  <video>
    <title>Earth vs. the Flying Saucers</title>
    <year>1956</year>
  </video>
</videos>
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
And finally execute the above query on this file to receive the following
result:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[h]{7.5cm}
\begin{verbatim}
<title>Plan 9 from outer space</title>
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
It is important to note the distinction of bound and free variables in FLWOR
constructs -- or, in other words, the scope boundaries. Consider the following
example:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$a in (1,2,3)} \\ \quad
  \texttt{return for \$b in (4,5,\$a)}\\ \quad\quad
    \texttt{return \$a + \$b}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When evaluating the for-clauses in this nested FLWOR expression, the
\textit{iterator sequence} is evaluated in the parent scope and not the
new scope for the current FLWOR expression. We can illustrate this point by
separating the scopes graphically:
\begin{figure*}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) [label=right:\texttt{for \$a in}]{};
\node at (2,0) [label=right:\texttt{(1,2,3)}]{};
\node at (0.5,-0.75) [label=right:\texttt{return for \$b in}]{};
\node at (3.9,-0.75) [label=right:\texttt{(4,5,\$a)}]{};
\node at (1.5,-1.5) [label=right:\texttt{return \$a + \$b}]{};
\draw[thick,dotted,rounded corners=8pt]
(0,0.25) -- (2.15,0.25) -- (2.15,-0.3) -- (3.8,-0.3) -- (3.8,0.25) ;
\draw[thick,dotted,rounded corners=8pt]
(0.5,-0.5) -- (4.05,-0.5) -- (4.05,-1.05) -- (6,-1.05);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure*}

As can be seen, the iterator sequence for the inner loop is evaluated in the
scope of the outer loop, and a new scope is not started until this iterator
sequence has been evaluated. Otherwise one could risk overwriting variables in
the iterator sequence when binding variables in the new scope.

Furthermore, a FLWOR construct may consist of several \texttt{for}- and
\texttt{let}-clauses in any order -- and each of these clauses may contain
several variable bindings. For example, the following is a valid XQuery
FLWOR expression:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$a in (1,2), \$b in (3,4) let \$c := 5, \$d := 6} \\ \quad
  \texttt{return \$a + \$b + \$c + \$d} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

However note that semantically this expression is equivalent to:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$a in (1,2) return} \\ \quad
  \texttt{for \$b in (3,4) return} \\ \quad \quad
    \texttt{let \$c := 5 return} \\ \quad \quad \quad 
      \texttt{let \$d := 6 return} \\ \quad \quad \quad \quad 
        \texttt{\$a + \$b + \$c + \$d} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The latter seems significantly less complex to parse, since this query embodies
no less than \emph{four} individual FLWOR expressions, each with one and only
one \texttt{for}- or \texttt{let}-clause. This raises the question, could it be
benefitial to rewrite complex FLWOR expressions into a simpler form? This
question is addressed in section \ref{sect:method:ast_rewrite} on page
\pageref{sect:method:ast_rewrite}.

\subsection{Full Text Extensions}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:fulltext_ext}
XQuery is by nature a structural query language -- that is, queries are based on
document/data structure and not on content. The full-text extensions to XQuery
reduces the smallest unit of an XML document to single words instead of nodes.
Additionally, they add sophisticated tools such as stemming, thesaurus, and
scoring variables.

Technically, the \verb!ftcontains! operator applies tokenisation of the first
operand, and searches for a match with the second operand among the tokens. It
allows specifying match options like stemming, thesaurus, etc to a second
operand modifying the criteria for finding a match. A full list of match
options are described in \cite{w3c01}.

For example, consider the following example:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$b in /books/book} \\
\texttt{where \$b/title ftcontains ("dog" with stemming case sensitive)} \\ \quad\quad\quad
\texttt{ftand "cat"} \\
\texttt{return \$b/author}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This will match any \texttt{book}-node where the \texttt{title}-node contains a word with the stem ``dog''.
Further, the word must be in lower case, and the word ``cat'' must reside inside the same node. The query will
return the \texttt{author}-node of these \texttt{book}-nodes. 

\subsection{XQuery Core}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:XQcore}
XQuery Core is a less powerful but semantically equivalent language for expressing
XQuery queries. XQuery Core as well as the process of normalising regular
XQuery to XQuery Core is described in the document ``XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0
Formal Semantics''\cite{xquery_semantics}.

The goal of this subset language is to simplify queries and remove syntactic sugar,
leaving only the essential semantics without loss of expressiveness.
This is useful for optimization routines and translations into new types of
queries, for example relational algebra or SQL.

The process of normalisation is described through a rich set of mapping
rules. These are documented in detail in \cite{xquery_semantics} and will not be reiterated here.
However we will examine some important examples.

First, however, it is important to take note of the syntax of the mapping
rules, as described in \cite{xquery_semantics}, section 3.2.2. 
 
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
$
[Object]_{Subscript}, premises == Mapped Object
$
  \caption{Mapping rules syntax}
  \label{figure:xquery:mapping_rules}
\end{figure}

Consider figure \ref{figure:xquery:mapping_rules}. Here, the left-hand side of the
equality symbol (==) denotes the original object to be rewritten. The
subscript indicates the type or kind of the object to be mapped, and/or
additional information to be passed between mapping rules. The right-hand side
denotes the rewritten object.

\subsubsection{Rewriting FLWOR expressions}
\label{sect:theory:xquery:core:rewriting_flwor}
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
[\texttt{for \$}$VarName_1$ $OptTypeDeclaration_1$ $OptPositionalVar_1$ \texttt{in} $Expr_1$\texttt{,}
\ldots, \texttt{\$}$VarName_n$ $OptTypeDeclaration_n$ $OptPositionalVar_n$ \texttt{in} $Expr_n$
$FormalReturnClause]_{Expr}$ \newline
$==$ \newline
\texttt{for \$}$VarName_1$ $OptTypeDeclaration_1$
$OptPositionalVar_1$ \texttt{in} $[Expr_1]_{Expr}$ \texttt{return} \texttt{\ldots for \$}$VarName_n$
$OptTypeDeclaration_n$ $OptPositionalVar_n$ \texttt{in} $[Expr_n]_{Expr}$ \texttt{return}
$[FormalReturnClause]_{Expr}$
  \caption{XQuery FLWOR expression to XQuery Core mapping rule}
  \label{figure:xquery:flwor_mapping_rule}
\end{figure}

The mapping rule for FLWOR \texttt{for}-clause expressions can be seen in figure
\ref{figure:xquery:flwor_mapping_rule}. The mapping rule for \texttt{let}-expressions is
similar and omitted for brevity, however they are also normalised into several nested bindings.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
$[$\texttt{where} $Expr_1 FormalReturnClause]_{Expr}$ \newline
$==$ \newline
\texttt{if(}$[Expr_1]_{Expr}$\texttt{) then }$[FormalReturnClause]_{Expr}$ \texttt{else ()}
  \caption{XQuery \texttt{Where}-clause to XQuery Core mapping rule}
  \label{figure:xquery:where_mapping_rule}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
$[$\texttt{stable}$?$ \texttt{order by} $OrderSpecList FormalReturnClause]_{Expr}$ \newline
$==$ \newline
$[OrderSpecList]_{OrderSpecList}$\texttt{ return }$[FormalReturnClause]_{Expr}$
  \caption{XQuery \texttt{order by}-clause to XQuery Core mapping rule}
  \label{figure:xquery:orderby_mapping_rule}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
$[$\texttt{return }$Expr]_{Expr}$ \newline
$==$ \newline
$[Expr]_{Expr}$
  \caption{XQuery \texttt{return} clause to XQuery Core mapping rule}
  \label{figure:xquery:return_mapping_rule}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the mapping rules for \texttt{where}-clauses, \texttt{order by}-clauses and
\texttt{return}-clauses can be seen in figures \ref{figure:xquery:where_mapping_rule},
\ref{figure:xquery:orderby_mapping_rule},
and \ref{figure:xquery:return_mapping_rule}.

For an example of how these rules are applied, consider the following FLWOR
expression:
%\verbatiminput{graph_queries/flwor_rewrite1.xq}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$i in (1, 2), \$j in (3, 4)} \\
  \texttt{let \$k := \$i + \$j} \\
  \texttt{where \$k >= 5} \\
   \texttt{return (\$i, \$j)} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

By applying the mapping rules described,  this expression is typically
rewritten to:
%\verbatiminput{graph_queries/flwor_rewrite2.xq}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{for \$i in (1, 2) return} \\ \quad
  \texttt{for \$j in (3, 4) return} \\ \quad
    \texttt{let \$k := \$i + \$j return} \\ \quad \quad
      \texttt{if (\$k >= 5) then} \\ \quad \quad \quad
        \texttt{(\$i, \$j)}\\ \quad \quad
      \texttt{else} \\ \quad \quad \quad
        \texttt{()}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The corresponding AST graphs can be seen in figures
\ref{tree:ast:flwor_rewrite1} and \ref{tree:ast:flwor_rewrite2}. In particular,
note that multiple \texttt{for}-clauses in a FLWOR expression is rewritten into several
nested FLWOR expressions, and that the \texttt{where}-clause is  rewritten into an
\texttt{if..then..else} expression. 
\newpage
\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[FLWOR AST tree before normalisation]{

 \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/graphs/flwor_rewrite2}
\label{tree:ast:flwor_rewrite2}
}
\caption{A FLWOR expression before and after normalisation.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Rewriting composite relative path expressions}
A composite relative path expression (for example, \verb!a/b!), can be
rewritten into a \texttt{for}-loop using the mapping rule in
\ref{figure:xquery:relpath_mapping_rule}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
$[RelativePathExpr / StepExpr]_{Expr}$ \newline
$==$ \newline
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{fs:apply-ordering-mode(} \\ \quad
\texttt{fs:distinct-doc-order-or-atomic-sequence(} \\ \quad\quad
    \texttt{let} \texttt{\$fs:sequence as node()* :=} $[RelativePathExpr]_{Expr}$ \texttt{return} \\\quad\quad
    \texttt{let \$fs:last := fn:count(\$fs:sequence) return} \\\quad\quad
    \texttt{for \$fs:dot at \$fs:position in \$fs:sequence return} \\\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad
       $[StepExpr]_{Expr}$ \texttt{))}
       \end{tabular}
  \caption{Composite relative path expression mapping rule}
  \label{figure:xquery:relpath_mapping_rule}
\end{figure}

Given the trivial example \verb!a/b!, this translates into the following block
of normalised code:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[h]{10cm}
\begin{verbatim}
fs:apply-ordering-mode (
fs:distinct-doc-order-or-atomic-sequence (
  let $fs:sequence as node()* := a return
  let $fs:last := fn:count($fs:sequence) return
  for $fs:dot at $fs:position in $fs:sequence return
    b))
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}


Which may seem like a rather verbose representation of such a simple path
expression. In particular, for complex path expressions this may
escalate into rather large rewritten expressions. However, this is a trade-off
to be made for normalisation of such path expressions.
