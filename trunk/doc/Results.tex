\chapter{Results}
\label{chapter:results}
This chapter will showcase a series of relational algebra trees. First, in
section \ref{sect:result:theoretical_algebra}, example trees computed by hand
using the rules for ``Tainting Dependencies'' are presented, showcasing
some major capabilities of this method. Further, in section
\ref{sect:result:implementation_algebra}, some trivial and complex queries are
generated by the prototype implementation and displayed. Furthermore, in
section \ref{sect:results:comparison}, comparisons are made to algebra
generated by Pathfinder/MonetDB using classic loop lifting.
