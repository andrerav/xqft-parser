\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have presented the essential resulting output from this
project. First we presented our test results, noting that we started out at   
54\% coverage which increased to 88\% after tweaking the parser somewhat.
Conformity of the parser (or, in some unfortunate cases, the lack thereof) is
further  discussed in section \ref{sect:future:knownBugs}. The coverage test
results are also further discussed in section
\ref{sect:discussion:coverageResults}.

Further we proposed some possible AST structures as generated by our parser, in
particular FLWOR constructs, path expressions, function declarations, and
full-text operations. However, these propositions are not definitive, and it
will take further research and possibly a ``trial-and-error'' approach to settle
on optimal AST structuring.

Finally we presented the error handling implemented in our parser, and some
possible problems with the current implementation. 

In the next chapter we will further elaborate on these issues and discuss
possible solutions.
