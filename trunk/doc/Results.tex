\chapter{Results}
\label{chapter:results}
This chapter will demonstrate a series of relational algebra trees. First, in
section \ref{sect:result:theoretical_algebra}, example trees computed by hand
using the rules for ``Tainting Dependencies'' are presented, utilising
some major capabilities of this method which is not supported by the prototype
implementation. Further, in section \ref{sect:result:implementation_algebra},
some trivial and complex queries are generated by the prototype implementation
and displayed. Furthermore, in section \ref{sect:results:comparison},
comparisons are made to algebra generated by Pathfinder which uses classic
loop lifting techniques.

\section{Summary}
\label{sect:res:summary}
In this chapter, a series of algebra trees have been presented. Specifically,
algebra computed by hand as well as algebra generated by the prototype
implementation has been presented. 

In the next chapter, these results as well as challenges and problems are
discussed in detail.
