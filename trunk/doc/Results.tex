\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have presented the essential resulting output from this
project. First we presented our test results, noting that we started out at   
54\% coverage which increased to 88\% after tweaking the parser somewhat.
Conformity of the parser (or the lack thereof) is further discussed in section
\ref{sect:future:knownBugs}. The coverage test results are also further
discussed in section \ref{sect:discussion:coverageResults}.

Further we proposed some possible AST structures as generated by our parser, in
particular FLWOR constructs, path expressions, function declarations, and
full-text operations.

Finally we presented the error handling
