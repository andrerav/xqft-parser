The search engines of today are well suited for finding relevant documents based
on simple search terms and various weighting and ranking schemes. However, few 
are capable of joining several query results.

One can imagine the following scenarion: A loving couple wants move to a new city.
She is a computer engineer, and he is a mathematician, and so they need  to find
a city with available jobs for the both of them. Further, they may need a house
with a swimming pool to live in within a vincity of 10 miles of the city, and
they don't want to live in a city where the density of public elementary schools
is too low to try and make sure that their children can go to a school they
truly like.

In order to find a city matching these criteria with todays commodity search
engine technology, they would need to perform several search queries and
compare, join and rank the results manually. Indeed this would be a lot of work!

Enter XQuery, an XML query language capable of performing complex nested
queries, extendable with full-text extensions, including linguistics such as
stemming and thesaurus. Additionally, XQuery queries can be translated into
querying relational data as well as XML data.

iAd \cite{iadcentre} (Information Access Disruptions) is an ongoing research
effort in ``next generation information access solutions'', in which this
project partake. Our specific goal is thus to develop a high quality XQuery
parser front end, with full-text extensions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Hvorfor XQuery (XQuery kan funke med baade XML og relasjonelle data)
\item Hvorfor full-tekst (XQuery stotter strukturelle sporringer men ikke i innhold)
\item Hvorfor java og aapen lisens (fordi FAST sa saa)
\item Rapportens struktur (gaa kjapt gjennom kapitler)
\end{itemize}
