\section{Tests}
\subsection{Unit tests}
Unit testing was used solely for regression testing, so they did not directly 
produce any results of particular interest.

\subsection{Manual tests}
To test for standards compliance, we created a manual test harness for running
the complete XQuery Test Suite\cite{w3c05} consisting of 12584 queries. Our
initial tests showed a 54\% coverage (6846 queries successfully parsed). Further
investigation revealed that out of all the errors, a total of 47\% were related
to NCName token ambiguities. Without these errors, coverage would increase to
76\%. Much effort was then spent on solving the remaining NCName ambiguities.

One peculiarity about ANTLR was the fact that the nextToken() method in the base
lexer class would catch recognition exceptions, display an error to stderr, and
then attempt to recover from the exception. Overriding this method and handling
the exception properly was not possible, since the nextToken() method is not
able to throw any exceptions. This obvious design flaw had been discussed on
several occasions on the ANTLR mailing list\cite{antlrmail}, but has not yet
been adressed by the ANTLR developers.
