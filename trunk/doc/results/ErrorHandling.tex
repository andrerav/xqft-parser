% ERROR HANDLING
\section{Error Handling}
\subsection{Syntax errors}
\label{sect:error_handling:syntax_errors}
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:impl:errorhandling}, error handling was added
by forcing ANTLR into throwing exceptions upwards to the calling program.

However, it quickly became appareant that some of the errors in the lexer were
not discovered by the parser, and no exceptions were thrown for these errors. The
lexer would simply print an error message to stderr, consume the offending
character, and attempt recovery. This led to complications when running the
XQuery Test Suite (see section \ref{sect:tests:manual}).
