\chapter{Architectual Decisions}
\label{chapter:method}

In this chapter we will present the decisions we made before implementing our
parser. We discuss the parser generator alternatives we had, how we debugged and
tested the parser, and finally we present the problem with the ambiguous
terminals and the alternative solutions considered to solve this.

\section{Summary}
We have now outlined the requirements for our parser generator, evaluated
several alternatives, and chosen one of these parser generators (ANTLR) based on
these requirements. We have also briefly presented debugging
strategies using ANTLRWorks and/or integrated development environments.

We have presented methods for performing general unit/regression testing
using jUnit as well as ANTLR-specific grammar unit testing using gUnit. We also
outlined how to use the XQuery test suite to perform coverage/conformity
benchmarking and compare our results to existing implementations.

Further, a small collection of popular open source licenses were reviewed, and
one (the new BSD license) was selected.

Finally we discussed the problem of ambiguous terminals in the grammar. We
proceeded to present and evaluate a number of lexer strategies to solve this,
and chose one solution (parser controlled state driven lexer) due to its
intuitivity and ease of implementation.

The next chapter will present ANTLR (the parser generator chosen for this
project) in more detail.
