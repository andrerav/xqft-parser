\chapter{Architectual Decisions}
\label{chapter:method}
Because we decided to create the parser with a generator, different alternatives of such tools had to be evaluated. In this chapter we will document this process. Further, we will present other decisions we made before implementating the recognizer. This constitutes the choice of licence and means testing the system. Finally we will present the problem with the ambiguous terminals and evaluate different lexer strategies that would solve this.

\section{Summary}
We have now outlined the requirements for our parser generator, evaluated
several alternatives, and chosen one of these parser generators (ANTLR) based on
these requirements. We have also briefly presented debugging
strategies using ANTLRWorks and/or integrated development environments.

We have presented methods for performing general unit/regression testing
using jUnit as well as ANTLR-specific grammar unit testing using gUnit. We also
outlined how to use the XQuery test suite to perform compliance
benchmarking and compare our results to existing implementations.

Further, a small collection of popular open source licenses were reviewed, and
one (the new BSD license) was selected.

Finally we discussed the problem of ambiguous terminals in the grammar. A number of lexer strategies to solve this were presented and evaluated. We chose the parser controlled state driven lexer due to its intuitivity and ease of implementation.

The next chapter will present the parser generator chosen for this
project, ANTLR, in more detail.
