\chapter{Architectual Decisions}
\label{chapter:method}

In this chapter we will present which choices we took before implementing our parser. We will discuss which parser generator alternatives we had, by which means we chose to debug and test the recognizer, and finally we will present the problem with the ambiguous terminals and the alternatives considered to solve this.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter we outlined criteria for our parser generator, evaluated
several alternatives, and chose one of these parser generators (ANTLR) based on
these criteria. We also briefly presented debugging strategies using
ANTLRWorks and/or integrated development environments.

Further we presented methods for performing general unit/regression testing
using jUnit as well as ANTLR-specific grammar unit testing using gUnit. We also
outlined how to use the XQuery test suite to perform coverage/conformity
benchmarking and compare our results to existing implementations.

Finally we discussed the problem of ambiguous terminals in the grammar. We
proceeded to present and evaluate a number of lexer strategies to solve this,
and chose one solution (parser controlled state driven lexer) due to its
intuitivity and ease of implementation.

In the next chapter, we will present ANTLR (the parser generator chosen for this
project) in more detail.
