\chapter{Method}
\label{chapter:method}
This chapter describes the most important decisions and constraints for this
project. Essentially, this chapter describes \emph{what will be done}, however
implementation-specific details are left to chapter
\ref{chapter:implementation}. This chapter is initiated by section
\ref{sect:method:tree_parsing}, where a method for tree parsing is chosen.
Further the method for rewriting the syntax tree is explained in section
\ref{sect:method:ast_rewrite}. Finally we present the target algebra language
(MQL), and the chapter ends with a description of a method for calculating
algebra complexity which will used in chapter \ref{chapter:results} for
comparisons.

\section{Development of a novel translation method}
\textbf{\LARGE TODO:} les over /glimrendeifiser plz.

In section \ref{sect:theory:loop_lifting}, ``Loop Lifting'', the Pathfinder project's method for translating XQuery
queries to relational algebra is presented. As the goal of this Master's thesis is to find a way to translate
queries in this language to MQL, the MARS query language, one possibility would be to modify the Loop Lifting
methodology to produce MQL trees instead. But this modified method would most probably not utilise the full
expressiveness and power of MQL. This lead to the development of a MARS specific method of translation, ``Tainting
Dependencies'', which will be reviewed in full in chapter \ref{chapter:translation}. Another incentive for not
modifying Loop Lifting is that it produces large quite complex operator trees, which lead to unnecessarily
denormalised intermediate results. This will be further discussed in section \ref{sect:disc:res}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sect:method:summary}
In this chapter the most significant decisions for this project have been
presented and explained in detail. In the next chapter, we will present our
novel methodology for translating XQuery queries to relational algebra, dubbed
``Tainting Dependencies''.
