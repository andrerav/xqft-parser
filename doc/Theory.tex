\label{chapter:theory}
XML is a markup language for encapsulating structured and semistructured
documents, relational data, and object repositories. A query languague capable
of querying XML data may thus be capable of querying across all these kinds of
data sources. In this chapter we will outline the basics of such a language, 
the XQuery XML query language, as well as the current state of research and
implementations.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we have presented the basic facets of XQuery and XPath,
especially language features such as FLWOR constructs, path expressions, 
full-text extensions, and precedence. This creates a context for the subsequent
chapters where we will set out to create an XQuery parser with full-text
extensions. 

Further we have investigated existing implementations, both with and without
full-text extensions. These implementations will provide valuable points of
reference for our implementation in the following chapters.

In the next chapter, we will outline the architectural decisions made in this
project.
