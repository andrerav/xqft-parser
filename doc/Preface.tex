\chapter*{Preface}

This Master's thesis was written at the Department of Computer and Informations Science (IDI) at the
Norwegian University of Science and Techology (NTNU) during the spring semester of 2008. The assignment was given
by and written for the Information Access Distruption centre (iAD). The supervisors of this project has been Svein
Erik Bratsberg at NTNU and \O ystein Torbj\o rnsen at Fast Search \& Transfer.

We would like to thank Svein Erik Bratsberg for feedback and proof reading of this report. Additionally we
would also like to thank \O ystein Torbj\o rnsen for taking time from his busy schedule giving guidance, feedback
