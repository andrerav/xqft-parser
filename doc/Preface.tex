\chapter*{Preface}

This report is the result of the the course "TDT4900 Datateknikk og
informasjonsvitenskap, masteroppgave" at the Norwegian University of
Science and Technology, during the spring of 2008. It is a response to the
following task description:

\begin{quote}
``XQuery is a query language for structured and semi-structured data. It is a
language search engines show a growing interest in applying. This project will
be based on the parser\cite{compiler_tech} developed during the autumn of 2007. The task is to
study possible improvements and make the parser generate query algebra for
execution. The resulting application must be written in Java and must be
licensed liberally."
\end{quote}

We would like to thank our supervisors, Svein Erik Bratsberg at NTNU and \O
ystein Torbj\o rnsen at Fast, for feedback and guidance during the course
of this project.
