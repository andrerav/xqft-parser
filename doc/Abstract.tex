\chapter*{Abstract}
XQuery is a flexible language for querying XML data across a variety of storage
methods. This thesis is a part of iAD, an ongoing research effort in
next generation information access solutions. iAD is hosted by Fast Search \&
Transfer, a company at the time developing their next search engine platform
MARS. This project seeks to investigate the utilisation of XQuery as a query
language for MARS.

The result of this project is a novel method of translation dubbed ``Tainting
Dependencies'' (TD) which seeks to avoid unecessary
denormalisation of intermediate results, and is designed specifically
for translation to MQL. This method supports a large subset of XQuery features.

Furthermore, we have developed a prototype implementation which supports basic
constructs such as FLWOR and sequence construction. TD is
then compared head-on to a similar method dubbed ``Loop Lifting'', and the
results of this comparison is evaluated through discussion.
