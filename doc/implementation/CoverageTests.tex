\section{Manual Coverage Tests}
\label{sect:implementation:manualCoverage}
The XQuery test suite supplied by W3C\cite{w3c05} consists of a number of
XQuery query files, and a corresponding set of output files with expected
output/result. Additionally, a central XML file describing all the tests with
references to files and folders are also supplied.

This file was parsed using a simple implementation of the reference SAX API
from the SAX project website\cite{saxproject}. For each applicable
test case, a new parser was instantiated and executed on the input file. If the
parser succeeded without throwing an exception, the test was considered passed.
This measurement of ``success'' was proposed in section \ref{sect:method:testing}.

Note that by ``applicable'' it is implied only tests which could be executed in
parse-time. That is, some tests require run-time features such as type
checking. This premise was presented in section \ref{sect:method:testing}.

The coverage was calculated by counting the number of passed tests, and
computing the percentage.
