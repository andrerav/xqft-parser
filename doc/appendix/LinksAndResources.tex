\chapter{Links, resources and further reading}
\label{appendix:links_and_resources}
This appendix details some additional material which may be of use for the
reader. Many of these resources are informally written, and should
be considered as such.

\section{Diagrams and graphs}
Large-scale versions of the DAG graphs in section \ref{sect:results:comparison}
can be found in the subversion repository for this project available at the
project website located at 
\htmladdnormallink{http://code.google.com/p/xqft-parser/}{http://code.google.com/p/xqft-parser/}.
In particular, all graphs are available in full-scale versions in the
\texttt{doc/img/graphs} folder in the project root, and all diagrams are
available in full-scale versions in the \texttt{doc/diagrams} folder.
Additionally, all example queries used throughout this project are available
in \texttt{doc/graph\_queries} and \texttt{doc/td\_src}.

\section{Further reading regarding XQuery}
Michael Rys maintains an interesting weblog which contains some writing about
the \emph{XQuery type system}. His weblog is located at
\htmladdnormallink{http://www.sqljunkies.com/WebLog/\newline mrys/archive/2004/05/13/2480.aspx}{http://www.sqljunkies.com/WebLog/mrys/archive/2004/05/13/2480.aspx}.

Michael Kay has written a series of papers and articles regarding XQuery and
practical use thereof, especially some interesting pieces on XQuery Core and
compilation of queries into Java bytecode. These writings are maintained at the
\emph{Saxon Diaries} website, located at
\htmladdnormallink{http://saxonica.blogharbor.com/}{http://saxonica.blogharbor.com/blog?cmd=search&keywords=xquery}.
