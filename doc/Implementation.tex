\chapter{Implementation}

\underline{\textbf{\LARGE //TODO:}} skriv om.
The main part of implementing the parser was to rewrite the EBNF provided by W3C in \cite{w3c01} to conform to ANTLR's syntax and semantics. In the following chapter we will present the reason why this was not a trivial task, the ambiguous terminals, and by which means we solved this. In addition we will present other ANTLR conforformity rewrites and finally our implementation of scoping and symbol tables.
