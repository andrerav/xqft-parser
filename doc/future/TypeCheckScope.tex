\section{Type Checking}
Currently the parser will not perform type checking on the parsed queries. This
is an essential feature and will be necessary to implement for the parser to be
applicable in any realistic setting. A type checking system with proper type
inference and synthesis could be a complex feature to implement in a language
such as XQuery, and might require considerable effort, especially in quality
assurance. 

\section{Scoping and Symbol Tables on AST}
Currently the scoping and symbol tables are being used directly in the grammar -
that is, during parse time. It would be benefitial to move this into being
performed in run time, and combine with type checking functionality.
