\chapter{Method}
\label{chapter:method}
This chapter describes the most important decisions and constraints for this
project. Essentially, this chapter describes \emph{what will be done}, however
implementation-specific details are left to chapter
\ref{chapter:implementation}. This chapter is initiated by section
\ref{sect:method:tree_parsing}, where a method for tree parsing is chosen.
Further the method for rewriting the syntax tree is explained in section
\ref{sect:method:ast_rewrite}. Finally we present the target algebra language
(MQL), and the chapter ends with a description of a method for calculating
algebra complexity which will used in chapter \ref{chapter:results} for
comparisons.

\section{Summary}
\label{sect:method:summary}
In this chapter the most significant decisions for this project have been
presented and explained in detail. In the next chapter, we will present our
novel methodology for translating XQuery queries to relational algebra, dubbed
``Tainting Dependencies''.
