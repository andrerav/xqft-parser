We decided to start this project because parser construction is an interesting
subject, and because the outcome, if successfull, would have real world
applicability. The rationale for writing a new parser instead of using an
existing one is simple -- as shown in section \ref{sect:theory:stateoftheart},
current full-text implementations are tightly coupled with their
host environment and unsuitable for integration with new backends, limited by
restrictive licenses, or simply available only in platform-dependent binaries
(as opposed to Java). 

In this chapter, we will discuss the outcome of this project and reflect over
our decisions. We will present and evaluate alternative decisions, and what
might have come of them. We will also discuss problems, how they were
solved, and attempt to reflect over how these problems could have been solved
differently.
