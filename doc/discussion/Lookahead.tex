Originally we were under the impression, incited by the W3C source \cite{createTokenizer}, that the W3C XQuery specification, and consequently, the W3C XQuery full-text specification, were expressed as LL(1) grammars. We experienced that this could not be true, as did Kang et.al.\cite{kang_xquery_diglib}. It turns out that W3C once had argued that the grammar was LL(1), but not the corresponding full-text version \cite{grammarIsLL1}. In the newest version of the specification, LL(1), or even LL, is not mentioned at all. About the a former version of the specification claiming the XQuery grammar (not full text) to be LL(1), Michael Dyck, once a member of the W3C full-text task force \cite{dyckIsTaskForce}, expresses\cite{dyckOnList}:
\begin{quote}
For one thing, the grammar as defined by the EBNF is ambiguous, and no ambiguous grammar can be LL(1). [\ldots] the claim must be that the grammar as defined by the EBNF and the precedence chart is LL(1). The problem then is that LL(1)-ness isn't defined for such a grammar.
\end{quote}
The same must hold true for the full text version, as it is an extension of XQuery.

That XQFT is at least LL(2) can be demonstrated by the fact that a single function call is a valid query, a query may start with a namespace declaration, which is on the form \verb!declare namespace...! and that \verb!declare! is a permitted function name. There is no way to left factorize these productions, if not one rendering the grammar complex and possibly containing redundancies.

After left factoring all productions applicable the grammar still is a minimum of LL(3). This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:notLL2}, which shows a syntacticly valid typeswitch expression according to the W3C specification. The value after a \verb!case! keyword in a typeswitch can be a \verb!NCName!, which with no reserved keywords can be the character sequence "sensitive".

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{Verbatim}
typeswitch($c) 
   case $c as comment() return $c ftcontains "x" 
   case sensitive return $p
   case surname return $p ftcontains "x" case sensitive
   default return ()
\end{Verbatim}

Because we chose the parser controlled strategy, our system's correctness depends on that the parser is a LL(k) parser with a small k.

Additionally, the grammar was, despite stated as such
by the W3C, not a LL(1) grammar but rather LL(k), for some undetermined \verb!k!
(also noted by \cite{kang_xquery_diglib}).
