\section{Manual Compliance Tests}
\label{sect:implementation:manualCoverage}
The XQuery test suite supplied by W3C\cite{w3c05} consists of a number of
XQuery query files, and a corresponding set of output files with expected
output/result for queries where this applies. Additionally, a central XML file
describing all the tests with references to files and folders are also supplied.

This file is parsed using a simple implementation of the reference SAX API
from the SAX project website\cite{saxproject}. For each applicable
test case, a new parser is instantiated and executed on the input file. If the
parser finishes without throwing an exception on a test defined to succeed, the test is considered passed.
This measurement of ``success'' was proposed in section \ref{sect:method:testing}.

Note that by ``applicable'' it is implied only tests which could be executed in
parse-time. That is, some tests require run-time features such as type
checking. This premise was presented in section \ref{sect:method:testing}.

The level of compliance was calculated by counting the number of passed tests, and
simply computing the percentage.
